This is a sample setup howto provision a new VM using Vagrant and setup Smallworld using Puppet.

KNOWN ISSUES
============

 * font file for 4.3 is reverted back to the one of 4.2, because the "nimbus sans l" font is unavailable;
 * answer file for installation doesn't really use an inline template, since
     it's not using ERB templating, but rather just the variables;

TODO
====

 * install swmfs
 * add questions as comments in the answer file for documentation;
 * support installing multiple versions;
 * find out what to do to build cambridge open (patch /etc/mtab??, to prevent ext4 bug in vmds??);
 * fix deps in class smallworld:
      smallworld::install -> smallworld::install::cambridge_db -> smallworld::install::emacs -> etc.
      this is because the install shouldn't fail when cambridge fails to install;
